-# Getting Started with Create React App
+**Portfolio Website**
 
-This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
+Overview
 
-## Available Scripts
+This project is a personal portfolio website developed using React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website showcases skills and contact details in a structured format.
 
-In the project directory, you can run:
+Features
 
-### `npm start`
+Home Page: Displays an introduction and social media links.
 
-Runs the app in the development mode.\
-Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
+About Section: Includes a short biography and background.
 
-The page will reload when you make changes.\
-You may also see any lint errors in the console.
+Skills Section: Lists programming languages and technologies.
 
-### `npm test`
+Contact Form: Allows users to send messages with validation.
 
-Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
-See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
+Navigation Bar: Provides links to different sections.
 
-### `npm run build`
+Footer: Displays copyright information.
 
-Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
-It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
+Preloader: Shows a loading screen before rendering the site.
 
-The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
-Your app is ready to be deployed!
+Animated Background: Adds a visual effect with moving dots.
 
-See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
+Technologies Used
 
-### `npm run eject`
+React.js (Component-based structure)
 
-**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
+HTML & CSS (For styling and layout)
 
-If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
+JavaScript (For interactivity)
 
-Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
+Installation
 
-You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
